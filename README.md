# WebBlargh

This is a "blog" (in quotes because it's really nothing yet) where I will:

* Experiment with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
    - I know a reasonable amount of JavaScript, but I really know barely anything about HTML or CSS and it's high time I learned. 
    - I've tried using bootstrap and other frameworks and so far they've just confused me. So at least initially, I'll be doing everything by hand myself, although I am using Jade for templating.
    - As such it looks incredibly poopy, but if I keep at it, after some amount of time it should start looking somewhat reasonable. I hope.
* Experiment with web programming in general
    - Another area that I have fairly limited knowledge in, but would like to learn. I'm starting out with express.js using TypeScript, but I might try other languages or other frameworks. I have many languages that interest me, some more suited to web dev than others (Haskell, Python, Go, Scala, Clojure, Julia, Rust, Nimrod, ...).

## So, where is it?
